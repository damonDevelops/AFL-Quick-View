            <h1>Privacy Policy for AFL Quick View Chrome Extension</h1>
        </header>
        <section>
            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>AFL Quick View ("the extension") is committed to protecting the privacy of its users. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you use the AFL Quick View Chrome Extension.</p>

            <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>The extension does not collect any personal identifiable information (PII) from its users. However, it may store non-personal data locally on the user's device for the purpose of enhancing the extension's functionality and user experience.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> The extension uses Chrome's local storage to store user preferences such as theme settings (light/dark mode) and cached AFL data (past games, future fixtures, and ladder standings). This data is stored locally on your device and is not shared with any external servers or third parties.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Use of Information</h2>
            <p>The extension uses the locally stored data to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Remember user preferences for a consistent experience.</li>
                <li>Cache AFL data such as match results and fixtures to improve performance and reduce the need for repeated network requests.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
            <p>AFL Quick View does not share any user data with third parties. All data stored by the extension is kept locally on the user's device.</p>

            <h2>5. Data Collection from External APIs</h2>
            <p>The extension fetches data from the following external APIs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Squiggle API (https://api.squiggle.com.au/):</strong> Provides AFL match data, including live scores, fixtures, and standings.</li>
                <li><strong>AFL API (https://aflapi.afl.com.au/):</strong> Provides the current round information.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These APIs are accessed directly from the user's device, and no data collected or received from these APIs is stored or transmitted to any third parties by the extension.</p>

            <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>The extension may interact with third-party services, such as APIs, to retrieve necessary data. However, the extension does not share user data with these services beyond what is necessary to fulfill its purpose of providing AFL information.</p>

            <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
